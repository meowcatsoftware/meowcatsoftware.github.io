			<h1>The Official MeowcatSoftware Priviacy Policy</h1>
			<br />
			<h2>As of April 22nd, 2019</h2>
			<p />MeowcatSoftware is undyingly dedicated to the privacy of those who interact with us. And unlike our distant cousins in the larger corporate picture (there's a reason we're not calling names here), we care about making sure you're ok with how we do things. Therefore, we would like to establish this human-readable privacy policy so that you know exactly what's happening with the data you share with us when, for example, you fill out communication forms from us.
			<br />
			<p />Some general rules we follow in regards to handling that information are lsited below:
			<ul>
				<li />We always ensure that you're ok with us having the information you'd send us. (in the case of our forms, you filling them out says 'yes' to that since you wouldn't be filling out the form otherwise.)
				<li />We will always get rid of any sensitive information you send us immediately after it's processed as needed unless you explicitly allow otherwise.
				<li />We always prompt everyone before using their information for anything. If you say no, we will respect that.
				<li />Even if you explicitly allow otherwise, we will never hold any collected information for longer than we originally explicitly indicate at the time of collection.
				<li />Anyone who is part of MeowcatSoftware that we catch using collected information without approval from the source gets banished from the group completely.
				<li />In special cases where special instructions are provided by the source of collected information for handling and removing said information, we will follow these instructions unconditionally and NOT request exceptions unless everyone involved is ok with it.
				<li />In special cases where collected information is protected by any sort fo documentation, leagally binding or otherwise, we will honor said protection and issue a signed statement of confirmation of the proposed terms before even accepting the information.
				<li />To enhance the security of any and all collected information, no department (even the executive/administrative) will be allowed to view collected information without explicit approval from the source. (in the case of our forms, you filling them out says 'yes' to that since you wouldn't be filling out the form otherwise.)
				<li />We will NEVER store collected information anywhere unless explicitly approved by the signing of an official document allowing for such actions to be taken. Both us and the source have to sign to make it a genuine document.
				<li />All official documents concerning collected information will be reviewed extensively and all terms will be approved prior to signing. This is to ensure that there are no loopholes.
				<li />If any loopholes are found in this policy or other official documentation concerning collected information they will be immediately patched and an official notice will be sent to all people it may concern.
				<li />If any information passes through a 3rd party, the source will have to verify that they agree to the 3rd party's privacy policy before the information will be allowed to tansfer.
				<li />If for any reason a data transfer happens and no authorized documentation allow it, the data transfer is immediately stopped and any related data is destroyed.
				<li />This policy and all official documents concerning collected information will be reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure the highest obtainable degree of integrity and security of the collected data and official documentation that concerns it.

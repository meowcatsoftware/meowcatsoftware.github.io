			<p />Please note that this website is under construction. Don't get confused if you encounter mysterious looking cacti or Latin-speaking webpages. Just don't make direct eye contact and you'll be fine. And by the way, weakpoints on our experiments with Project ConCactus has allowed someone from another universe, a man named Dr. Wallace Breen, to hack our website and use it to spread propaganda. Don't listen to anything he says. The Resistance must not fall.

			<h1 id="breen-propoganda">A Warning to Citizens of City 17</h1>
			<p id="breen-propoganda"/>We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens. His figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance and decay. Some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa Incident have been laid directly at his feet. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the One Free Man, the Opener of the Way. Let me remind all citizens of the dangers of magical thinking. We have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our species' evolution. Let us not slide backward into oblivion, just as we have finally begun to see the light. If you see this so-called Free Man, report him. Civic deeds do not go unrewarded. And contrariwise, complicity with his cause will not go unpunished. Be wise. Be safe. Be aware.
